RL agent: takes in a message (+context) as input, ouputs text
Reward net: takes in a sentence as input and predicts the sentiment of a human response to it. Trained using movie dataset + stock senitment analysis


Problem: agent outputs gibberish
Solution: discriminator net between model and real sentences

Problem: agent overfits to reward net
Solution:
- Force output variety
- Train n reward nets and randomize
- Discriminator helps too
